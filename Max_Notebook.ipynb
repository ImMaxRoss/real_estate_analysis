A business problem you could focus on for this stakeholder is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.\n"

    "\n",
    "* **Your goal in regression modeling is to yield findings to support relevant recommendations. Those findings should include a metric describing overall model performance as well as at least two regression model coefficients.** As you explore the data and refine your stakeholder and business problem definitions, make sure you are also thinking about how a linear regression model adds value to your analysis. \"The assignment was to use linear regression\" is not an acceptable answer! You can also use additional statistical techniques other than linear regression, so long as you clearly explain why you are using each technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you must build multiple models. Begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs in the notebook discussing your final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data visualization and analysis are still very important.** In Phase 1, your project stopped earlier in the CRISP-DM process. Now you are going a step further, to modeling. Data visualization and analysis will help you build better models and tell a better story to your stakeholders."

    "\n",
    "1. Fork the [Phase 2 Project Repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-5), clone it locally, and work in the `student.ipynb` file. Make sure to also add and commit a PDF of your presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.\n",
    "2. Or, create a new repository from scratch by going to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and copying the data files from the Phase 2 Project Repository into your new repository.\n",
    "   - Recall that you can refer to the [Phase 1 Project Template](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template) as an example structure\n",
    "   - This option will result in the most professional-looking portfolio repository, but can be more complicated to use. So if you are getting stuck with this option, try forking the project repository instead\n"
