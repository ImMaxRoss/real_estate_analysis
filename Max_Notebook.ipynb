With a very large test statistic of 50073454.459 and the p-value of 0.00, we can reject the null hypothesis of normality, indicating a violation of normality assumption.\n",

Positive skewness means there are more observations on the left side of the distribution, while negative means more observations on the right side.

A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, and if it is greater than 3, it is said to be leptokurtic or heavy-tailed, and if it is less than 3, it is said to be platykurtic or light-tailed.
