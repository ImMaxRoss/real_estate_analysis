Most fields were pulled from the [King County Assessor Data Download](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx).

The `address`, `lat`, and `long` fields have been retrieved using a third-party [geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/). In some cases due to missing or incorrectly-entered data from the King County Assessor, this API returned locations outside of King County, WA. If you plan to use the `address`, `lat`, or `long` fields in your modeling, consider identifying outliers prior to including the values in your model.

### Condition Column info:

Relative to age and grade. Coded 1-5.

1 = Poor- Worn out. Repair and overhaul needed on painted surfaces, roofing, plumbing, heating and numerous functional inadequacies. Excessive deferred maintenance and abuse, limited value-in-use, approaching abandonment or major reconstruction; reuse or change in occupancy is imminent. Effective age is near the end of the scale regardless of the actual chronological age.

2 = Fair- Badly worn. Much repair needed. Many items need refinishing or overhauling, deferred maintenance obvious, inadequate building utility and systems all shortening the life expectancy and increasing the effective age.

3 = Average- Some evidence of deferred maintenance and normal obsolescence with age in that a few minor repairs are needed, along with some refinishing. All major components still functional and contributing toward an extended life expectancy. Effective age and utility is standard for like properties of its class and usage.

4 = Good- No obvious maintenance required but neither is everything new. Appearance and utility are above the standard and the overall effective age will be lower than the typical property.

5= Very Good- All items well maintained, many having been overhauled and repaired as they have shown signs of wear, increasing the life expectancy and lowering the effective age with little deterioration or obsolescence evident with a high degree of utility.


### Grade Column Info:
